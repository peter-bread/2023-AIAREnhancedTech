## AR Interactions

### Problems
#### 1. Limited Documentation and Resourcesï¼š
Since ARkit is a relatively new framework, I mainly looked up the documentation on the Apple website to learn how to use it. However there are a lot of problems for which Apple doesn't have a clear official solution, the actual cost of learning is much higher.
       
#### 2. Difficult practical interaction structures
Because the actual AR scene needs to contain many models as well as many complex interaction actions, it is not easy to be able to establish the structure of the entire AR interaction
