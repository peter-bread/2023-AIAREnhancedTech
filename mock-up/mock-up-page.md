# Design Concepts

This is a preliminary page illustrating the concepts and ideas we were exploring during the initial stages of the project. We will discuss, the ideas we had, what we took to the client and the feedback we recieved to shape the direction we took. You can see how our very first ideas materialised into a mobile application.

## Initial Concept

These are the very first ideas we had when thinking about creating the augmented reality experience. We had a lot ideas about what this might look like in theory; we also had to balance this with what was feasable given the scope of the project.

This initial Mockup presented to client was based upon the "Remote Ecosystem Diagram"

We developed conceptual designs for the augmented diagram and presented these mock-ups to the client for review and feedback.

Our initial design was inspired by a specific example, which served as a foundational reference.

Using this example as a starting point, we crafted our own unique mockup design.

This design presents a visually engaging and user-friendly interface, enabling users to interact seamlessly with their documentation. In the lower left corner, you'll notice 'Watson,' a virtual assistant designed to aid in understanding the documentation. Watson is envisioned as a 3D figure, skillfully anchored within the 3D space captured by the user's camera, enhancing the overall interactive experience.

When users interact with an element within the augmented reality diagram, it will expand to offer additional, in-depth details about that specific section of the documentation. This interactive feature is designed to enhance understanding by providing context-sensitive information on-demand.

Our  design was mapped by this specific example.

Drawing from this example as our reference, we created an original mock-up design.
