# Design Concepts

This is a preliminary page illustrating the concepts and ideas we were exploring during the initial stages of the project. We will discuss, the ideas we had, what we took to the client and the feedback we recieved to shape the direction we took. You can see how our very first ideas materialised into a mobile application.

## Initial Concept

These are the very first ideas we had when thinking about creating the augmented reality experience. We had a lot ideas about what this might look like in theory; we also had to balance this with what was feasable given the scope of the project.

This initial Mockup presented to client was based upon the "Remote Ecosystem Diagram"
