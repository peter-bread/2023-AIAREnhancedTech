# Key points during the meeting with mentor

## AR kit structure:
ARKit provides a high-level API with a simple interface and a series of powerful functions.
It provides two kinds of AR technology, one is based on 3D scene (SceneKit) and
2D scene (SpriktKit) to achieve augmented reality. Tracking is the core function of ARKit,
which is the ability to track devices in real time.

## Workflow:
Put the code on the main branch only when we want to release it, so only Dev branch go into main branch.
Create different feature branches during development, one branch per feature. Eg: a branch for AR kit.
