# 2023-AIAREnhancedTech

## Project Summary

The project's objective is to develop a mobile application that leverages Augmented Reality technology to offer enhancements and supplementary information for Galasa Documentation.

### Ambitions for final product

We create a fully functional mobile application - a user can move their phone over Galasa documentation into the cameras frame and AR enhancement is shown. This enhancemnt involves providing more detail about the diagram with help of an AI assistant, it will also turn static digrams into moving and enhance the image to make it more visually appealing. The User will be able to ask quitions to the AI Assistant to gain more information.

Develop a fully functional mobile application that enriches a users their experience with Galasa Documentation through Augmented Reality. By simply moving their phone's camera over Galasa documentation, users will witness AR enhancements. These enhancements involve several key features:

1. **Detailed Information**: An AI assistant will provide in-depth explanations and context for diagrams, making complex information more understandable.

2. **Interactive Diagrams**: Static diagrams will come to life, offering dynamic representations that enhance understanding.

3. **Visual Appeal**: The application will improve the visual aesthetics of diagrams, making them more engaging and informative.

4. **Interactive Querying**: Users will have the ability to interact with the AI assistant by asking questions, enabling them to delve deeper into the subject matter.

Our mobile app transforms the way users interact with Galasa Documentation, providing an immersive and informative experience using Augmented Reality technology.
